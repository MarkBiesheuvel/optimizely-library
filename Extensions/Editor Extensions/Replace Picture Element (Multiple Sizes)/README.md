# Replace Picture Element (Multiple Sizes)

## Description

Extension that replaces the image references within a picture element by inserting new multiple sized and backup images. 

## Steps

1. In the <b>Select the Picture Element</b> field, select a picture element you wish to change using the visual editor, and make sure the selector is the picture element itself as the extension is rewriting the source and img source references within.
2. Paste in the new image URL paths in the <b>Small Image URL</b>,<b>Medium Image URL</b>, <b>Large Image URL</b>, and <b>Backup Image URL</b> fields.
3. Give the backup image a new alt tag in the <b>Backup Image alt</b> field.

* Source Image URL
* Source Image alt

## Next Steps
